# **1. Project Title**

# **LinkingLions**

# Linking Lions empowers Loyola Marymount University students and alumni to connect through a dedicated online platform, fostering mentorship, career exploration, and professional development, ultimately strengthening the LMU community and enhancing career outcomes for students.

# **Who are you helping?** 
	# Loyola Marymount University students, alumni, and professors.
# **What problem are you solving?** 
	# Bridging the gap between students and alumni to facilitate mentorship, networking, and career development opportunities.
# **How will you solve that problem?**
	# By creating an online platform with features for creating profiles, finding mentors, scheduling coffee chats, discovering relevant events, and  accessing industry-specific resources.
# **What impact will your solution have?**
	# A stronger LMU community, enhanced student career opportunities, and a more engaged alumni network. Students will feel more prepared and  confident going into the job search and LMU will strengthen the opportunities they can place their students into.

# **What is the real problem being addressed**
	# The real problem being addressed is the lack of a dedicated and comprehensive platform for Loyola Marymount University students and alumni to  connect for mentorship, career exploration, and professional development. This lack of a centralized platform creates missed opportunities for  valuable interactions and knowledge sharing between students and alumni, potentially hindering students' career preparation and alumni engagement  with their alma mater. 
# **Past attempts to solve the problem** 
	# The Career and Professional Development has been put in place to solve this problem by providing the following services. **Handshake** is a 
	  platform where students can directly apply for open internships and full-time positions. Handshake also provides events for students in person  and virtual to increase their knowledge of the industry and help them find new opportunities. The events product of Handshake is inconsistent and  many events that students "RSVP" are not sent to the hosts of the events. Students who RSVP on Handshake are not guaranteed to be  invited to the event as Handshake is simply the middleman between the students and the employer. Students may waste time preparing for these  events, and the individuals posting these events are wasting resources in finding these events. 
	# LinkedIn Learning is a tool that helps students take courses taught by industry professionals around a myriad of subjects. LMU provides this free  of charge for their students. This is very good, however, students need a direction of specific courses to take to guide them in the right  direction. LinkingLions will help in this manner by reducing the time students waste taking courses that might not be relevant to their target  professional roles. 
	# BigInterview / V Mock helps students work on their interview skills as well as their resumes. However, they only help with basic interview issues, like eye contact, using filler words, and other basics. While this is still a positive, interviewers are looking for specific industry knowledge, a very inspiring and well-spoken story, as well as a passion to join the specific firm - all of which BigInterview provides little support. V Mock helps fix the wording and formatting of the resume, but individuals who are hiring students are not the ones giving feedback on the resumes. Students who score higher on V Mock are not more likely to be hired and they might be wasting time and effort perfecting their resume according  to the software rather than professional feedback.

	# The Pride is a very good resource and has the same function as what our end goal is. The Pride allows students to set preferences and be given  profiles of alumni that fit their criteria. However, it is not promoted well, and students should not have to provide very specific details about  their goals which might cost them a few alumni connections. For example, with simple search criteria of looking for a job, and building my resume  for Finance, only two Alumni were selected that I could reach out to. It would be better for me to choose from the list of all Alumni who have  jobs in financial services as they all could reasonably give resume help and promote jobs. The Pride is very similar to what we are trying to  create, but we'd like to integrate more opportunities and events that students can attend as well as industry-specific study material that  students can learn as underclassmen before looking for internships and full-time roles.
